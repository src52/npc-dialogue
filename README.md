# NPC dialogue

RuneLite utility to make it easier to transcribe NPC dialogue onto the wiki. Example: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Maedhros#Dialogue

Copies all NPC dialogue, player dialogue, dialogue options, and chosen options into a panel that can be copied from. This does minimal formatting â€“ the end user still needs to do some stuff before it goes on the wiki.
